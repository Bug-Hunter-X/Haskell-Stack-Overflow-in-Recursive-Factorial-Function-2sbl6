This Haskell code attempts to use a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number. However, it suffers from a stack overflow error for larger inputs because it doesn't utilize tail recursion.  ```haskell
factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)```
